gramatically corrected version:
These are not my games, do not say they are, and please do not sue me.
Also, I recommend using my HTML file launcher, but it's not required. Also, if your school blocks JavaScript in file URLs, encode the HTML into a data URL using urlencoder.org. Once you have your encoded text, go to a new tab and type data:text/html,  and then paste the encoded text into the search bar, and enjoy your launcher.
